# Project Ulterior

Project Ulterior aims to decentralize engineering and facilitate the sharing of engineering work.

For businesses, Project Ulterior is an Engineering-as-a-Service. Businesses are able to develop & operate projects (websites, apps, services, etcâ€¦)  built on reusable components developed by the community.

For developers, Project Ulterior is an open community where engineering knowledge is shared. Businesses with engineering needs will post requests which developers can accept at an agreed rate.

For students, Project Ulterior is a learning platform where an aspiring developer can see past work and follow working developers.

Initial offerings will be focused on web development but the ideas introduced should naturally extend out to all sectors of the software development.
